# Overview

Example of overlapping sections with css :has() and css modules, with
added complexity of a wrapper (think an astro-island) around some of the
sections that are supposed to be overlapping.

## Run

1. `npm run dev`
1. Go to http://localhost:3000

## Review

Review `src/app/page.css` to see the bulk of the overlap styles.
